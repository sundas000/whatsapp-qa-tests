## Platform Behavior

- **Android**: All Help options are bundled under `Settings > Help`.
- **iOS**: Similar layout but may open Apple-provided support view or browser for some actions.
- **Web/Desktop**: Help generally opens via `Menu > Help` and redirects to the web FAQ.

## Notes
- App info (version/build) is especially useful for support and debugging.
- Contact Us form pre-fills technical data (like OS, device model) in some cases.
- Some links like Terms of Service may open in an external browser.
